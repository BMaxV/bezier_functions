# simple bezier like interpolation

again, nothing fancy.

May need my vector module. if you find a nice and easy replacement for the vectors let me know.

this started out because my engineering classes mentioned bezier curves
and I want to just have them as a tool in my toolbox.

this is using the linear to smooth interpolation as well. Maybe to showcase something, idk.

but I also added some half done, not quite spline function,
that works just on neighbors, and still meets the continuity requirements
that splines are actually good for. so... "kind of the same thing"

but not actually splines. I think.
